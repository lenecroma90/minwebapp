This is a simple web application for managing a list of books. Users can add new books by entering the title and author, and view all registered books in a list. The app uses Node.js with Express for the backend, MySQL for data storage, and a minimal frontend with HTML and CSS. The backend provides API endpoints to fetch all books and to add new ones. The frontend includes forms for adding books and displays the book list dynamically using JavaScript.
